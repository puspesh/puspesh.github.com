## Trying out prose.io

Prose.io seems pretty interesting and I am planning to build something on top of it. Just stumbled on it looking for something cool on top of Jekyll to host static websites/blogs and it caught my eye in an instant. Here is the fork (https://github.com/puspesh/prose.git) in case someone would like to keep track. I have also updated the setup instructions so that the github auth can work locally to allow github repo access through the js interfact itself. 

Lets hack!
